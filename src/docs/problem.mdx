  <p style={{ fontSize: '16px', lineHeight: 1.5, color: '#34495e' }}>Modern AI chat systems often provide responses from a single AI agent, limiting the diversity of thought, collaboration, and access to specialized AI resources. Additionally, using a single LLM model restricts the ability to leverage diverse AI capabilities and insights. Piecemealing multiple LLM agents creates a broken string of data without effectively leveraging the strengths of other agents. This approach is often expensive and inefficient. Many users lack the time, resources, and knowledge to integrate various AI agents effectively.</p>
  <p style={{ fontSize: '16px', lineHeight: 1.5, color: '#34495e' }}>UnifAI bridges this gap by enabling a think tank of primary AI agents that collaboratively diagnose and analyze user inputs. These primary agents work alongside a unified network of specialized agents, which are seamlessly brought into the conversation as needed. This approach ensures a richer and more targeted interaction, addressing challenges that require both general and specialized expertise while maximizing the utility of AI resources.</p>
